# LEETCODE-Strings-241
I'd be glad to provide a dry run of the given code, illustrating its step-by-step execution for a specific input:

**Input:** "2*3-4+5"

**Output:** [7, 3]

**Dry Run:**

1. **Function Call:** The `diffWaysToCompute` function is called with the input string "2*3-4+5".

2. **Memoization Check:** The `ways` function checks if the input string "2*3-4+5" is already present in the memoization map. Since it's not, the function proceeds to calculate the results.

3. **Iteration:**
   - The outer loop iterates from index 0 to the length of the string (4).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current character is an operator:
     - For index 0, the character is '2', which is not an operator, so the loop continues.
     - For index 1, the character is '*', which is an operator.

4. **Recursive Calls:**
   - For the operator '*', two recursive calls are made:
     - `ways("2", mem)`: This calculates the ways to compute the substring "2", which is simply 2.
     - `ways("3-4+5", mem)`: This recursively calculates the ways to compute the substring "3-4+5".

5. **Recursive Calculations:**
   - The recursive call for "3-4+5" will further break down the string and make more recursive calls.
   - The process continues until the substrings become single digits, which are then directly converted to integers and added to the memoization map.

6. **Result Calculation:**
   - For the operator '*', the results from the recursive calls (2 and 7) are combined using multiplication: 2 * 7 = 14.
   - This result is added to the list `ans`.

7. **Memoization Update:**
   - The result list `[14]` is stored in the memoization map for the key "2*3-4+5".

8. **Iteration Continuation:**
   - The outer loop continues with the next index (2) and the same process is repeated for the operator '-'.
   - Similar recursive calls and calculations are made for the substrings "2*3" and "4+5".

9. **Final Results:**
   - After considering all operators and their combinations, the final list `ans` contains the following results:
     - [7, 3]

10. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns the list `ans` containing the different ways to compute the expression.

**Explanation:**

- The code uses a divide-and-conquer approach with memoization to efficiently calculate the different ways to compute the expression.
- It breaks down the expression into smaller substrings and recursively calculates the results for each substring.
- The memoization map is used to store intermediate results, avoiding redundant calculations.
- The final result is a list containing all possible combinations of the calculated values.
